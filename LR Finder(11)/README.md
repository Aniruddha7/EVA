## Implementation of LR Finder for a custom deep learning model using Cifar-10 dataset

-> In this project we try to apply a custom DL model along with regularization techniques such as Dropouts, L2_ regularization to minimize losses

-> Use the optimum learning rate before trainig the model to get better accuracy and local minima

->We will also try using augmentation strategies such as Cut Out to avoid overfitting

->After plotting accuracy graph we try to find out misclassified images.
