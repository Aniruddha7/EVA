What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?
A kernel/weight matrix/filter/feature extractor is used to extratct features from the input image to store in channels or feature maps and the values of kernels can also change to notify that it is learning to extract specific features. Kernels convolve on top of images or any input data and only similar features are stored and separate channels has to be maintained for separate features. For out convinience we compute all input images using 3x3 kernel

Here is the example for 3x3 convolution
